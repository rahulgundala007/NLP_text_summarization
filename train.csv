PNC,OVERDRAFT PROTECTION AGREEMENT,"Overdraft Protection: This Agreement provides the terms and conditions of the PNC Bank Overdraft Protection service. Please read this Agreement and keep it with your important account information. 1. I/we, have designated certain of my/our account(s) as PROTECTING ACCOUNT(S) for the purpose of adding overdraft protection service and have authorized PNC Bank to apply this service to my/our designated PROTECTED ACCOUNT. If PNC has determined that sufficient funds are not available in the PROTECTED ACCOUNT to cover account withdrawals, PNC Bank will automatically transfer funds or credit from the PROTECTING ACCOUNT(S) as follows: A. If there are sufficient funds to cover some but not all of my/our overdrafts, PNC Bank will exercise its discretion (i) in paying some but not all of the items and (ii) to pay items drawn on the PROTECTED ACCOUNT in any order convenient to PNC Bank. PNC Bank’s general practice is to first add deposits (credits) to my/our Account, and then subtract withdrawals (debits) from my/our Account. Transactions are ordered according to the date and time the bank receives notice of the transaction. PNC Bank receives notice of transactions at various times throughout the day, and not necessarily in the order in which they occur. If multiple transactions are received at the same time, or are grouped together and contain no time, then the items will be processed in order of sequence number or, if no sequence number is available, largest-to-smallest dollar amount. If PNC Bank does not have information that allows it to determine the exact time notice of a transaction was received, PNC Bank may assign an approximated time to that transaction. Debit card purchases will be posted according to the date and time provided by the merchant. Because processing times vary, the time PNC Bank receives notice of a transaction may differ from the time shown on a receipt. page 27 of 31 RDAOPM11-0224The order of payment may affect the total number of items paid and/or returned and/or the amount of overdraft fees charged. B. At such time or times that PNC Bank determines that the PROTECTED ACCOUNT has insufficient funds, PNC Bank will transfer to the PROTECTED ACCOUNT an amount sufficient to pay all items creating the insufficient balance  first from funds or credit available in the first designated PROTECTING ACCOUNT, and, if an overdraft still exists, from funds or credit available in the second PROTECTING ACCOUNT, if a second PROTECTING ACCOUNT has been designated. If the PROTECTING ACCOUNT is a line of credit or credit card account, the amount transferred will be rounded upward to the next whole dollar. In rare circumstances, the amount transferred may overdraw the PROTECTING ACCOUNT if transactions are posted to the PROTECTING ACCOUNT after the transfer amount has been determined. C. If the PROTECTING ACCOUNT is a deposit account, PNC Bank will transfer the exact amount of the overdraft from the PROTECTING ACCOUNT. If the PROTECTING ACCOUNT is a line of credit or credit card, PNC Bank will not make any automatic transfer in amounts less than $50.00. D. This is not an extension of credit. If the PROTECTING ACCOUNT is a deposit account, PNC Bank shall not be obligated to transfer funds to the PROTECTED ACCOUNT if such a transfer will exceed the funds available in the deposit account. If the PROTECTING ACCOUNT is a credit card account, PNC Bank shall not be obligated to transfer funds to the PROTECTED ACCOUNT if the credit card account is in default, if your right to use the credit card account is closed or suspended, or if the transfer would exceed the credit card account’s cash advance limit. If the PROTECTING ACCOUNT is a line of credit account, PNC Bank shall not be obligated to transfer funds to the PROTECTED ACCOUNT if the transfer will cause the balance on the line of credit account to exceed the Maximum Credit. PNC Bank shall not be obligated to transfer funds to the PROTECTED ACCOUNT if the transfer will in any way violate the terms of the agreement(s) which governs the PROTECTING ACCOUNT(S). Finally, a scheduled transfer between PNC accounts will not be processed if the account (checking, savings, or money market) from which the funds are being transferred does not have sufficient funds, even if that account is set up with overdraft protection. E. Balances for all types of PROTECTING ACCOUNTS are available for nightly processing of items, for transactions process by branch tellers, and for point of sale or ATM online authorizations. F. I/we may from time to time contact PNC Bank to request a modification of this agreement by adding or substituting a different account as PROTECTING ACCOUNT 1 or 2. PNC Bank reserves the right to accept such modification of this Agreement or to require that a new Agreement be executed. 2. I/we understand that if any PROTECTING ACCOUNT is a line of credit or credit card account, any transfers that are made from such an account for purposes of overdraft protection will be subject to the terms of the line of credit agreement or credit card agreement, as applicable, including all rules, fees and other disclosures made with the agreement as well as any applicable fees set forth in PNC Bank’s Consumer Schedule of Service Charges and Fees. If the PROTECTING ACCOUNT is a credit card account, this credit card may be a PNC branded card issued by a third party card issuer, and I authorize PNC Bank and such issuer to share information necessary to process my overdraft protection transactions and administer this overdraft service. I authorize PNC Bank to update the credit card account number for my PROTECTING ACCOUNT if such issuer provides PNC Bank with a new credit card account number for me/us. 3. I/we understand that if any PROTECTING ACCOUNT is a checking, savings or money market deposit account, any transfers that are made from such an account for purposes of overdraft protection will be subject to the terms of the Account Agreement for Personal Checking, Savings and Money Market Accounts, and PNC Bank’s Consumer Schedule of Service Charges and Fees, together with any other disclosures provided in connection with the account. I/we understand that transfers made from any checking, savings or money market deposit account will count toward any applicable transaction limitations set forth in the Account Agreement for Personal Checking, Savings and Money Market Accounts, including limitations on preauthorized transfers (including telephone and automatic transfers) each monthly service charge period. 4. This authorization may be modified and/or terminated at any time by PNC Bank upon notice to me/us and I/we understand that it will terminate automatically without notice if all PROTECTING ACCOUNTS are closed. If any PROTECTING ACCOUNT is a Home Equity Line of Credit account, then this authorization with respect to such account may not be terminated by PNC Bank except in accordance with my/our Home Equity Line of Credit account agreement.","The PNC Bank Overdraft Protection service agreement provides a detailed overview of how the bank's overdraft protection works, including the terms and conditions that govern the service. Here are the key elements of the agreement: 1. **Overdraft Protection Setup**: You can designate one or more of your PNC accounts as protecting accounts to cover overdrafts in your protected account. If an overdraft occurs, PNC will automatically transfer funds from the protecting account(s) to cover the shortfall. 2. **Discretionary Payment of Overdrafts**: If there are insufficient funds to cover all overdrafts, PNC has the discretion to determine which items to pay and in what order, potentially affecting the number of items paid or returned and the amount of overdraft fees charged. 3. **Transfer Amounts and Conditions**: - If the protecting account is a deposit account, PNC will transfer the exact overdraft amount. - For credit lines or credit cards, transfers won't be made for amounts less than $50.00, and only if the account isn't in default, closed, suspended, or exceeding its cash advance limit. - The agreement specifies conditions under which PNC won't transfer funds, including insufficient funds in a deposit account or exceeding credit limits. 4. **Balances Availability**: Balances in all types of protecting accounts are available for nightly processing, transactions by branch tellers, and for POS or ATM authorizations. 5. **Modification of Agreement**: You can request modifications to the agreement by adding or changing the designated protecting accounts, subject to PNC's approval. 6. **Terms for Credit Lines or Credit Cards**: Transfers from credit lines or credit cards for overdraft protection are subject to the terms of the respective credit agreement, including any fees and charges. 7. **Terms for Deposit Accounts**: Transfers from checking, savings, or money market accounts are subject to the terms of the personal account agreement and may count towards transaction limits. 8. **Modification and Termination**: PNC may modify or terminate the overdraft protection service at any time, with the termination being automatic if all protecting accounts are closed. For Home Equity Lines of Credit accounts, termination conditions are subject to the account agreement. This agreement emphasizes the importance of understanding how overdraft protection works, the conditions under which funds will be transferred to cover overdrafts, and the potential fees and impacts of such transfers. Customers are encouraged to carefully review these terms and conditions to effectively manage their accounts and avoid unnecessary overdraft fees."

Microsoft,Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver,"Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver If You Live In (or, If a Business, Your Principal Place of Business Is In) the United States. We hope we never have a dispute, but if we do, you and we agree to try for 60 days, upon receipt of a Notice of Dispute, to resolve it informally. If we can’t, you and we agree to binding individual arbitration before the American Arbitration Association (""AAA"") under the Federal Arbitration Act (""FAA""), and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury. Instead, a neutral arbitrator will decide and the arbitrator’s decision will be final except for a limited right of review under the FAA. Class action lawsuits, class-wide arbitrations, private attorney-general actions, requests for public injunctions, and any other proceeding or request for relief where someone acts in a representative capacity aren’t allowed. Nor is combining individual proceedings without the consent of all parties. ""We,"" ""our,"" and ""us"" includes Microsoft and Microsoft’s affiliates. a. Disputes Covered—Everything Except IP. The term ""dispute"" is as broad as it can be. It includes any claim or controversy between you and us concerning the Services, the software related to the Services, the Services’ or software’s price, your Microsoft account, marketing, communications, your purchase transaction, billing, or these Terms, under any legal theory including contract, warranty, tort, statute, or regulation, except disputes relating to the enforcement or validity of your, your licensors’, our, or our licensors’ intellectual property rights. b. Send a Notice of Dispute Before Arbitration. If you have a dispute that our customer service representatives can’t resolve and you wish to pursue arbitration, you must first send an individualized Notice of Dispute to Microsoft Corporation, ATTN: CELA Arbitration, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, U.S.A., or submit the form electronically. The Notice of Dispute form is available at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245499. Complete that form in full, with all the information it requires. We’ll do the same if we have a dispute with you. This Notice of Dispute is a prerequisite to initiating any arbitration. Any applicable statute of limitations will be tolled from the date of a properly submitted individualized Notice of Dispute through the first date on which an arbitration may properly be filed under this section 15. c. Small Claims Court Option. Instead of sending a Notice of Dispute, either you or we may sue the other party in small claims court seeking only individualized relief, so long as the action meets the small claims court’s requirements and remains an individual action seeking individualized relief. The small claims court must be in your county of residence (or, if a business, your principal place of business). d. Arbitration Procedure. The AAA will conduct any arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules (or if you are an individual and use the Services for personal or household use, or if the value of the dispute is less than $75,000 whether or not you are an individual or how you use the Services, its Consumer Arbitration Rules). For more information, see www.adr.org or call 1-800-778-7879. Section 15 and these Terms govern to the extent they conflict with any applicable AAA rules. To initiate an arbitration, submit the Demand for Arbitration form available at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245497 to the AAA and mail a copy to us. The form must contain information that is specific to you and your claim. In a dispute involving $25,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic or by videoconference unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead. Any in-person hearing will take place in your county of residence (or, if a business, your principal place of business). The arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only to you individually to satisfy your individual claim, but not relief that would affect non-parties. The arbitrator rules on all issues except that a court has exclusive authority: (i) to decide arbitrability, as well as formation, existence, scope, validity, and enforceability of this arbitration agreement; (ii) to decide whether the parties have complied with the pre-arbitration requirements (including the individualized Notice of Dispute and Demand for Arbitration forms); (iii) to enforce the prohibition on class, representative, private attorney-general, or combined actions or proceedings, or public injunctive relief; and (iv) to enjoin an arbitration from proceeding if it does not comply with this section 15. If your Notice of Dispute involves claims similar to those of at least 24 other customers, and if you and those other customers are represented by the same lawyers, or by lawyers who are coordinating with each other, you and we agree that these claims will be “Related Cases.” Related Cases may only be filed in batches of up to 50 individual arbitrations at a time, and those individual arbitrations will be resolved in the following manner: (i) for the first batch, each side may select up to 25 of these Related Cases to be filed and resolved in individual arbitrations under this section 15; (ii) none of the other Related Cases may be filed or prosecuted in arbitration until the first batch of up to 50 individual arbitrations is resolved; and (iii) if, after that first batch, the parties are unable to informally resolve the remaining Related Cases, a second batch of Related Cases may be filed, where each side may select up to 25 of the Related Cases to be resolved in individual arbitrations under this section 15. This process of batched individual arbitrations will continue until the parties resolve all Related Cases informally or through individual arbitrations. A court has exclusive authority to enforce this paragraph, including whether it applies to a given set of claims, and to enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations that do not comply with this paragraph. e. Arbitration Fees and Payments. i. Disputes Involving Less Than $75,000. We will promptly reimburse your filing fees and pay the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses if: (i) the dispute involves less than $75,000; and before initiating arbitration (ii) you complied with all pre-arbitration requirements in this section 15, including, if applicable, the Related Cases paragraph. Otherwise, the AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses. If, at the conclusion of the arbitration, the arbitrator awards you more than our last written offer made before the arbitrator was appointed, we will: pay you (i) the amount of the award or $1,000 (whichever is more); and; (ii) for any reasonable attorney’s fees you incurred; and any reasonable expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney accrued in connection with your individual arbitration. ii. Disputes Involving $75,000 or More. The AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses. f. Rejecting Future Arbitration Changes. You may reject any change we make to section 15 (except address changes) by personally signing and sending us notice within 30 days of the change by U.S. Mail to the address in section 15.b. If you do, the most recent version of section 15 before the change you rejected will apply. g. Severability. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, a court finds any part of this section 15 unenforceable as to any claim or request for a remedy, then the parties agree to arbitrate all claims and remedies subject to arbitration before litigating in court any remaining claims or remedies (such as a request for a public injunction remedy, in which case the arbitrator issues an award on liability and individual relief before a court considers that request). Otherwise, if any other part of section 15 is found to be unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect (with an arbitration award issued before any court proceeding begins).","In the United States, disputes with Microsoft are to be resolved through binding arbitration rather than in court, except for intellectual property disputes. This agreement involves a 60-day attempt to resolve disputes informally before moving to arbitration with the American Arbitration Association under the Federal Arbitration Act. It prohibits class action lawsuits or arbitration, combining individual proceedings without all parties' consent, and any representative actions. Disputes encompass a broad range of issues related to Microsoft's services, software, pricing, accounts, and terms under any legal theory. The process includes submitting a Notice of Dispute to Microsoft, with the possibility of small claims court for individual relief under certain conditions. Arbitration covers disputes of any value, with specific rules for those involving less than $75,000, including Microsoft reimbursing filing and arbitration fees under certain conditions. Changes to the arbitration agreement can be rejected by the user, and if any part of the arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the rest remains effective, aiming to keep disputes within the arbitration framework as much as possible."

PNC,CONSUMER FUNDS AVAILABILITY POLICY,"Introducing Our Funds Availability Policy When you deposit checks and similar items to your PNC Bank account, you expect us to make the funds available for your use as quickly as possible. Our Funds Availability Policy is designed to do just that. Depending on the type of non-cash deposit you make, your funds may be available as quickly as the next business day. Of course, depending on the amount, type and source of your non-cash deposit, there are situations when your deposit will take longer to become available for your use. Our Funds Availability Policy provides detailed information about when funds you deposit will become available for your use. This policy is in effect for accounts opened in all PNC Bank markets. Please take a moment to review this Policy. By understanding how we make your deposits of non-cash items available, it will be easier for you to manage your account and realize all the benefits of banking with PNC Bank. Determining Availability of a Deposit We determine availability by counting the number of business days from the business day of your deposit. Every day except Saturday, Sunday and a federal holiday is a business day. If a deposit is received through one of our branch tellers, ATM, mobile device, remote deposit scanner, electronic deposit (i.e. ACH, Zelle®, Real-Time Payments), or by mail before our cut-off time, we will consider that day to be the day of your deposit. However, if a deposit is received after our cut-off time or on a day that is not a business day, we will consider the deposit as being received on the next business day that we are open. Our cut-off time is 10:00 p.m. ET. Further, deposits made through our night depository after 6:00 a.m. ET may be processed on the next business day. Availability varies depending on the type of deposit and is explained below. Checks drawn on banks located outside of the United States are not subject to this availability Policy. Please inquire regarding availability at the time you make such deposits. Initial $100 of Your Deposit The initial $100 of any deposit will be available on the evening of your deposit to pay checks or items that are presented to us that evening for posting. The balance of the $100, if any, will be available on the first business day after the business day of your deposit for all purposes. The remaining balance of your total deposit will be available depending on the type of deposit, as described in the availability provisions for each deposit as otherwise stated in this Policy.

Special Rules for New PNC High Yield Savings Accounts Opened Online When you open a new High Yield Savings account through PNC Online Banking, we will place an initial hold on the account for a period that will not exceed 5 business days, beginning with the business day on which your online application is completed (or next business day if application completed on a non-business day).

When the initial hold is removed from your account, funds from your deposits, including deposits made during the initial hold period, will be available according to the other provisions of this Policy.

All deposits not discussed in this section will be available as described elsewhere in this Policy. A. Funds from travelers checks deposited with a special deposit ticket, funds from deposits outlined as items “f” through “j” in the “Items Excluded from Large Dollar Deposit Calculation” section above, and $125 from deposited checks or items will be available on the first business day after the business day of your deposit for all purposes.

In this case, funds from the deposit of checks will usually be available no later than the fifth business day after the business day of your deposit for all purposes. Other restrictions are set forth in the Electronic Funds Transfer Disclosure Statement Brochure. Refusal of a Deposit We continue to reserve the right not to accept deposits. In some circumstances, items unacceptable for deposit, such as a mutilated check, may be processed as collection items. Accelerated Availability If you make a deposit of checks or money orders on a business day that we are open, we may make part of your deposit available to you sooner than otherwise stated in this Policy. The balance of your deposit will become available according to the other terms of this Policy. Endorsement It is important that you place your endorsement carefully on the back of all checks you are depositing. A 1½ inch area has been designated for your endorsement. Please ask your PNC Bank customer service representative about proper placement of your endorsement. If your endorsement is illegible because you have endorsed the check in the wrong location, you will be liable for any resulting losses. Your Responsibility You agree that PNC Bank may deduct the amount of a deposited check from your account balance if PNC Bank receives notice that the check has not been paid. PNC Bank may make this deduction even if the unpaid check has not yet been returned to the Bank. You agree that PNC Bank may charge an unpaid check against your account even if PNC Bank could claim reimbursement for the check from the bank on which the check was drawn or from some other bank. You agree that PNC Bank may charge a check back even if the charge results in an overdraft. page 20 of 31 RDAOPM11-0224If you have any further questions about this Funds Availability Policy, please contact your local branch or call us at 1-888PNC-BANK (1-888-762-2265).","The PNC Bank's Funds Availability Policy is designed to quickly make funds from non-cash deposits available to account holders. Here’s a summary of key points: Determining Availability: The availability of your deposit depends on the type of deposit and when it's made. Business days exclude weekends and federal holidays. Deposits made before the 10:00 p.m. ET cut-off time on business days are processed the same day; deposits after the cut-off time or on non-business days are processed the next business day. Initial $100 Availability: The first $100 of any deposit becomes available on the evening of the deposit day to cover checks or items presented that evening. The remaining $100 becomes available the next business day. Same-Day Availability: Cash deposits, checks or money orders drawn on PNC Bank, wire transfers, online banking transfers, and electronic deposits (e.g., ACH, Zelle®, Real-Time Payments) made before the cut-off time are available the same business day. Next-Day Availability: Deposits of checks or money orders drawn on PNC Bank made before the cut-off time are available the evening of the deposit day. Other checks or money orders are available the next business day. Large Dollar Deposits: Deposits of checks exceeding $50,000 in one business day have different availability rules. The first $100 is available on the evening of the deposit day, an additional $125 the next business day, and the remaining funds the second business day after the deposit. Special Rules for New Accounts: New account holders have different availability rules for the first 30 days. Certain funds will be available the next business day, while others will be available the second business day. Longer Delays: In certain situations, such as suspicion that a deposited check will not be paid or after depositing checks totaling $50,000 or more, there may be a longer delay in funds availability.

You understand and agree, however, that YouTube may retain, but not display, distribute, or perform, server copies of your videos that have been removed or deleted.

If you have a Microsoft account and are located in a participating Region (defined below), you have been automatically enrolled in the Rewards Program and can begin earning Points immediately. You can cancel your participation in the Rewards Program at any time by following the instructions below. ii. You can redeem your Points in a variety of ways (""Redemption Options""), including for certain products and services listed on the Redemption Page at https://aka.ms/redeemrewards (""Rewards""). To be eligible to redeem your Points for any Redemption Option, you must first activate your Rewards Program account (""Rewards Account"") on the Rewards Dashboard at https://rewards.microsoft.com/ or on certain other Microsoft sites and pages. There is no cost to activate your Rewards Account. iii. Certain restrictions and limitations apply to earning, redeeming, and other uses of Points in the Rewards Program. For more information see the Rewards section at https://support.microsoft.com (""FAQ""). iv. Requirements. You need a valid Microsoft account and you must reside in one of the geographic areas listed in the FAQ (""Regions"") to activate your Rewards Account and to earn, redeem, or otherwise use Points. You may open and use only one Rewards Account, even if you have multiple email addresses. Each household is limited to six Rewards Accounts. The Rewards Program is solely for your personal and noncommercial use. Use of a virtual private network (VPN) or other technology or service that can be used to mask or obfuscate your geographic location may result in cancellation of your Rewards Account and forfeiture of your accrued Points. v. Earning Points. You may be presented with opportunities to earn Points for certain qualifying activities (""Offers""), such as Searches, Acquisitions, use of certain Microsoft products and services, and other opportunities from Microsoft. You must have an active Rewards Account to take advantage of such Offers. Eligible Offers may vary by Region and may only be available for a certain time or subject to other limitations. You must comply with all terms and conditions of a particular Offer to earn Points awarded with that Offer. You may be presented with Offers directly on the Rewards Dashboard or when you use certain Microsoft products and services. vi. For purposes of the Rewards Program, a ""Search"" is the act of an individual user manually entering text for the good faith purpose of obtaining Bing search results for such user’s own research purposes and does not include any query entered by a bot, macro, or other automated or fraudulent means of any kind; and an ""Acquisition"" is the process of purchasing goods or downloading and acquiring a license for digital content directly from Microsoft, whether free or paid. Points are not offered for every Acquisition from Microsoft, and certain restrictions may apply. vii. Restrictions & Limitations on Points. Points are awarded by Microsoft to individual Rewards Accounts and cannot be transferred to any other person or entity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Microsoft may from time to time in its sole discretion permit you (i) to share your Points within your household (limits may apply), (ii) to contribute your Points to support a nonprofit organization listed on the Redemption Page, or (iii) depending on your Region and subject to other terms and conditions, to redeem all or some of your Points for points in certain other rewards or loyalty programs, including programs operated by Microsoft or authorized third parties. Points are and remain at all times the property of Microsoft, and do not constitute your personal property; they have no cash value, and you may not obtain any cash or money in exchange for them. Points are awarded to you on a promotional basis only. You cannot purchase Points. Microsoft may limit the quantity of Points or Rewards that can be earned or redeemed per person, per household, or over a set period (e.g., a day) provided that you are not disadvantaged in breach of good faith; please refer to the FAQ for currently applicable limitations. Unless an Offer or Redemption Option explicitly states otherwise, Points earned in the Program are not valid in, and may not be used in combination with, any other program offered by Microsoft or third parties. Unredeemed Points associated with your Rewards Account expire if you do not earn or redeem any Points in your Rewards Account for 18 consecutive months. viii. Redemptions Redemption Options will be made available to you on the Redemption Page and on certain other Microsoft sites and pages. You must earn and have available in your Rewards Account all of the Points required for a Redemption Option before you can redeem your Points for that Redemption Option. There may be a limited number of a particular Reward available, and those Rewards will be delivered on a first-come, first-served basis. You may be required to provide additional information, like your mailing address and a telephone number (other than a VOIP or toll-free number), and you may also be asked to enter a fraud-prevention code or sign additional legal documents to redeem Points for certain Redemption Options. Once you redeem your Points, you cannot cancel or return the Redemption Option for a refund of Points except in the case of defective products or as required by applicable law. If you select a Redemption Option that is out of stock or unavailable for other reasons, we may substitute a Redemption Option of comparable value or refund your points at our sole discretion. ix. Microsoft may update or discontinue offering specific Redemption Options at any time for any reason. Some Redemption Options may have age or Region eligibility requirements, or other terms or conditions on their redemption or use. Any such requirements or conditions will be included in the relevant redemption offer. You are responsible for all federal, state, and local taxes and any other costs of accepting and using the Redemption Option. Rewards will be emailed to the email address associated with your Microsoft account, so keep your email address up to date. Rewards that are undeliverable will not be reissued and are therefore forfeited. Rewards may not be resold. You may redeem no more than 550,000 Points per calendar year in the Rewards Program. x. Cancelling Your Rewards Account. If you no longer wish to participate in the Rewards Program, follow the instructions on the opt out page (https://account.microsoft.com/rewards/optout?confirm=false) to cancel your Rewards Account. If you cancel your Rewards Account, you will immediately forfeit all of your earned Points and will lose your ability to earn new Points in the future. To begin earning Points again, you must open a new Rewards Account (but Microsoft will not reinstate any previously forfeited Points). Your Rewards Account may be cancelled (and your Points forfeited) if you do not log in to your Microsoft account for 18 consecutive months. xi. Program Changes or Discontinuation. Microsoft reserves the right to change, modify, discontinue, or cancel the Rewards Program or any part thereof at any time, in its sole discretion, and without prior notice. However, if the Rewards Program is cancelled or discontinued, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you by email and on the Rewards Dashboard and to provide you with at least 90 days to redeem your accrued Points, unless we determine that such cancellation must take effect immediately for legal or security reasons. xii. Other Terms. Microsoft reserves the right to immediately cancel your Rewards Account, disqualify you from future participation in the Rewards Program, forfeit all of your earned Points, and cancel or suspend any Redemption Option you have obtained through the Rewards Program if Microsoft believes you have tampered with, abused, or defrauded any aspect of the Rewards Program or breached these terms. Microsoft further reserves the right to cancel or suspend any Redemption Option you have obtained or attempted to obtain through the Rewards Program if Microsoft determines you are ineligible to receive that Redemption Option for legal reasons (such as export laws). While Microsoft makes every effort to ensure accuracy, errors occasionally occur. Microsoft therefore reserves the right to correct such errors at any time, even if it affects current Offers or your pending, earned, or redeemed Points or Rewards. In the event of any inconsistency or discrepancy between these Rewards Program terms or other statements contained in any related materials or advertising, these terms prevail, govern, and control.","Microsoft 365 Apps and Services cater to personal, noncommercial use with various apps like Word, Excel, and Outlook governed by supplemental license terms. Additional terms for Outlook include the use of Bing Maps under specific conditions. Health bots are intended for wellness purposes and not as medical device substitutes. Digital Goods across Microsoft's services are for personal entertainment, with strict no-redistribution rules. OneDrive storage limits apply, with potential account closure for exceeding quotas. Microsoft Rewards offers a point-based system for engaging with Microsoft products and services, with specific earning, redeeming, and usage conditions. Changes to the Rewards Program or discontinuation will be communicated, and misuse may result in account cancellation and forfeiture of points."
PNC,INTEREST PAYMENT AND BALANCE COMPUTATION,"Your interest rate and Annual Percentage Yield may change. At our discretion, we may change the interest rate(s) and Annual Percentage Yield(s) on your account at any time without notice to you. Interest on all consumer interest-bearing checking, savings and money market deposit accounts is compounded monthly and credited on the last day of each monthly statement period. For Savings accounts with quarterly statements interest is credited on the last day of each calendar month. If you close your account before interest is credited, you will not receive the accrued interest. We use the daily balance method to calculate the interest on your account. This method applies a daily periodic rate to the collected balance in the account each day. The daily periodic rate is 1/365 of the interest rate, or we may use 1/366 in a leap year. Tiered-rate accounts earn interest on the entire account balance each day at the interest rate and annual percentage yield in effect for the appropriate balance tier. Interest begins to accrue no later than the business day we receive credit for the deposit of checks and other non-cash items. Interest does not accrue on balances under $1.00. Unless stated otherwise, the term “month” means monthly statement period. If you use the combined average monthly balances in your qualifying checking account(s) to avoid the monthly service charge on a Performance Checking or Performance Select Checking account, then on the statement date of your Performance Checking or Performance Select Checking account, we review the average monthly balance for each related account for the current statement period. The average monthly balance is calculated by adding the collected balance in each of your related accounts for each day of the current statement period and dividing that figure by the number of days in the current statement period.","This section explains how interest rates and Annual Percentage Yield (APY) on your bank account can change at the bank's discretion, without prior notice to you. Interest for consumer interest-bearing checking, savings, and money market accounts is compounded monthly and credited on the last day of the statement period. For savings accounts with quarterly statements, interest is credited monthly. If you close your account before interest is credited, you will forfeit the accrued interest. Interest calculation is based on the daily balance method, applying a daily periodic rate to the collected balance each day. This rate is determined by dividing the annual interest rate by 365, or 366 in a leap year. For accounts with tiered interest rates, the entire account balance earns interest at the rate and APY corresponding to the applicable balance tier each day. Interest accrual starts no later than the business day on which non-cash deposits (like checks) are credited to your account. However, balances below $1.00 do not earn interest. The term ""month"" refers to the monthly statement period, not the calendar month. For specific accounts like Performance Checking or Performance Select Checking, you can avoid monthly service charges by maintaining combined average monthly balances in qualifying accounts. This average is calculated daily for the current statement period and divided by the number of days in that period to determine if the service charge can be waived."

Payment Terms 9. Payment Terms. If you purchase a Service, then these payment terms apply to your purchase and you agree to them. a. Charges. If there is a charge associated with a portion of the Services, you agree to pay that charge. The price stated for the Services excludes all applicable taxes and currency exchange settlements, unless stated otherwise. The price for Skype paid products includes a charge for the product and a charge for taxes. You are solely responsible for paying such taxes or other charges. Taxes are calculated based on your location at the time your Microsoft account was registered. We may suspend or cancel the Services if we do not receive an on time, full payment from you. Suspension or cancellation of the Services for non-payment could result in a loss of access to and use of your account and its content. Connecting to the Internet via a corporate or other private network that masks your location may cause charges to be different from those displayed for your actual location. b. Your Billing Account. To pay the charges for a Service, you will be asked to provide a payment method at the time you sign up for that Service. You can access and change your billing information and payment method on the Microsoft account management website (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618281) and for Skype by signing into your account portal at https://skype.com/go/myaccount. Additionally, you agree to permit Microsoft to use any updated account information regarding your selected payment method provided by your issuing bank or the applicable payment network. You agree to promptly update your account and other information, including your email address and payment method details, so we can complete your transactions and contact you as needed in connection with your transactions. Changes made to your billing account will not affect charges we submit to your billing account before we could reasonably act on your changes to your billing account. c. Billing. By providing Microsoft with a payment method, you (i) represent that you are authorized to use the payment method you provided and that any payment information you provide is true and accurate; (ii) authorize Microsoft to charge you for the Services or available content using your payment method; and (iii) authorize Microsoft to charge you for any paid feature of the Services you choose to sign up for or use while these Terms are in force. We may bill you (a) in advance; (b) at the time of purchase; (c) shortly after purchase; or (d) on a recurring basis for subscription Services. Also, we may charge you up to the amount you have approved, and we will notify you in advance of any change in the amount to be charged for recurring subscription Services. We may bill you at the same time for more than one of your prior billing periods for amounts that haven't previously been processed. d. Recurring Payments. When you purchase the Services on a subscription basis (e.g., monthly, every 3 months or annually), you agree that you are authorizing recurring payments, and payments will be made to Microsoft by the method and at the recurring intervals you have agreed to, until the subscription for that Service is terminated by you or by Microsoft. You must cancel your Services before the next billing date to stop being charged to continue your Services. We will provide you with instructions on how you may cancel the Services. By authorizing recurring payments, you are authorizing Microsoft to store your payment instrument and process such payments as either electronic debits or fund transfers, or as electronic drafts from your designated account (for Automated Clearing House or similar payments), or as charges to your designated account (for credit card or similar payments) (collectively, ""Electronic Payments""). Subscription fees are generally charged in advance of the applicable subscription period. If any payment is returned unpaid or if any credit card or similar transaction is rejected or denied, Microsoft or its service providers reserve the right to collect any applicable return item, rejection or insufficient funds fee and process any such payment as an Electronic Payment. e. Online Statement and Errors. Microsoft will provide you with an online billing statement on the Microsoft account management website (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618282), where you can view and print your statement. For Skype, you can access your online statement by signing into your account at www.skype.com (https://www.skype.com). This is the only billing statement that we provide. If we make an error on your bill, you must tell us within 90 days after the error first appears on your bill. We will then promptly investigate the charge. If you do not tell us within that time, you release us from all liability and claims of loss resulting from the error and we won't be required to correct the error or provide a refund. If Microsoft has identified a billing error, we will correct that error within 90 days. f. Refund Policy. Unless otherwise provided by law or by a particular Service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable. If you believe that Microsoft has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge. No refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old. We reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion. If we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future. This refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply. For more refund information, please visit our help topic (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618283). g. Canceling the Services. You may cancel a Service at any time, with or without cause. Cancelling paid Services stops future charges to continue the Service. To cancel a Service and request a refund, if you are entitled to one, visit the Microsoft account management website. You can request a refund from Skype using the Cancellation and Refund form (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618286). You should refer back to the offer describing the Services as (i) you may not receive a refund at the time of cancellation; (ii) you may be obligated to pay cancellation charges; (iii) you may be obligated to pay all charges made to your billing account for the Services before the date of cancellation; and (iv) you may lose access to and use of your account when you cancel the Services. We will process your Data as described above in section 4. If you cancel, your access to the Services ends at the end of your current Service period or, if we bill your account on a periodic basis, at the end of the period in which you canceled. If you initiate a chargeback or reversal with your bank for your payment of Services, we will deem you to have canceled as of the date that the original payment was made, and you authorize us to immediately cancel your service and/or revoke any content that was provided to you in exchange for such payment. h. Trial-Period Offers. If you are taking part in any trial-period offer, you may be required to cancel the trial Service(s) within the timeframe communicated to you when you accepted the offer in order to avoid being charged to continue the Service(s) at the end of the trial period. i. Promotional Offers. From time to time, Microsoft may offer Services for a trial period during which Microsoft will not charge you for the Services. Microsoft reserves the right to charge you for such Services (at the normal rate) if Microsoft determines (in its reasonable discretion) that you are breaching the terms and conditions of the offer. j. Price Changes. We may change the price of the Services at any time and if you have a recurring purchase, we will notify you by email, or other reasonable manner, at least 15 days before the price change. If you do not agree to the price change, you must cancel and stop using the Services before the price change takes effect. If there is a fixed term and price for your Service offer, that price will remain in force for the fixed term. k. Payments to You. If we owe you a payment, then you agree to timely and accurately provide us with any information we need to get that payment to you. You are responsible for any taxes and charges you may incur as a result of this payment to you. You must also comply with any other conditions we place on your right to any payment. If you receive a payment in error, we may reverse or require return of the payment. You agree to cooperate with us in our efforts to do this. We may reduce the payment to you without notice to adjust for any previous overpayment. l. Gift Cards. Redemption and use of gift cards (other than Skype gift cards) are governed by the Microsoft Gift Card Terms and Conditions (https://support.microsoft.com/help/10562/microsoft-account-gift-card-terms-and-conditions). Information on Skype gift cards is available on Skype’s Help page (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=615383). m. Bank Account Payment Method. You may register an eligible bank account with your Microsoft account to use it as a payment method. Eligible bank accounts include accounts held at a financial institution capable of receiving direct debit entries (e.g., a United States-based financial institution that supports automated clearing house (""ACH"") entries, a European financial institution that supports Single Euro Payments Area (""SEPA"") or ""iDEAL"" in the Netherlands). Terms you agreed to when adding your bank account as a payment method in your Microsoft account (e.g., the “mandate” in the case of SEPA) also apply. You represent and warrant that your registered bank account is held in your name or you are authorized to register and use this bank account as a payment method. By registering or selecting your bank account as your payment method, you authorize Microsoft (or its agent) to initiate one or more debits for the total amount of your purchase or subscription charge (in accordance with the terms of your subscription service) from your bank account (and, if necessary, initiate one or more credits to your bank account to correct errors, issue a refund or similar purpose), and you authorize the financial institution that holds your bank account to deduct such debits or accept such credits. You understand that this authorization will remain in full force and effect until you remove your bank account information from your Microsoft account. Contact customer support as outlined above in section 4.e as soon as possible if you believe you have been charged in error. Laws applicable in your country may also limit your liability for any fraudulent, erroneous or unauthorized transactions from your bank account. By registering or selecting a bank account as your payment method, you acknowledge that you have read, understand and agree to these Terms.","Microsoft may change terms, require software updates, and alter or discontinue services or features at any time. Continued use post-updates implies agreement. Updates are sometimes automatic and may be necessary to continue service use, under the same or additional terms. Microsoft may also modify or cease services or access to third-party apps and services without obligation to provide a replacement or refund. For DRM-protected content, updates may automatically install. The software provided is licensed, not sold, with use limited to one device per copy for personal use, subject to these terms. Activities like circumvention of security, reverse engineering, or unauthorized sharing or modification of software or services are prohibited. Payment terms apply when purchasing services, including responsibility for all charges, taxes, and accurate billing information. Microsoft may change service prices and will notify users in advance for recurring subscriptions. Purchases are generally non-refundable, with specific conditions for cancellations and refunds. Price changes will be communicated, and continuing service use after a price change indicates acceptance. Payments from Microsoft are subject to compliance with request requirements and applicable taxes. Gift cards and bank account payments are subject to specific terms and financial institution capabilities."

Fair Use Policies. Fair usage policies may apply to your use of Skype. Please review these policies which are designed to protect against fraud and abuse and may place limits on the type, duration or volume of calls or messages that you are able to make. These policies are incorporated in these Terms by reference. You can find these policies at: https://www.skype.com/en/legal/fair-usage/. v. Mapping. Skype contains features that allow you to submit information to, or plot yourself on a map using, a mapping service. By using those features, you agree to these Terms and the Google Maps terms available at https://www.google.com/intl/en_ALL/help/terms_maps.html. vi. Personal/Noncommercial Use. The use of Skype is for your personal and noncommercial use. You are permitted to use Skype at work for your own business communications. vii. Skype Number/Skype To Go. If Skype provides you with a Skype Number or Skype To Go number, you agree that you do not own the number or have a right to retain that number forever. For more details on Skype Number see https://secure.skype.com/en/skype-number/. viii. Skype Manager. A ""Skype Manager Admin Account"" is created and managed by you, acting as an individual administrator of a Skype Manager group and not as a business entity. You may link your individual Microsoft account to a Skype Manager group (""Linked Account""). You may appoint additional administrators to your Skype Manager group subject to their acceptance of these Terms. If you allocate Skype Numbers to a Linked Account, you are responsible for compliance with any requirements related to the residency or location of your Linked Account users. If you choose to unlink a Linked Account from a Skype Manager group, any allocated subscriptions, Skype Credit or Skype Numbers will not be retrievable and Your Content or material associated with the unlinked account will no longer be accessible by you. You agree to process any personal information of your Linked Account users in accordance with all applicable data protection laws. ix. Skype Charges. Skype paid products are sold to you by Skype Communications S.à.r.l, however the seller-of-record accountable for taxes is Skype Communications US Corporation. Taxes means the amount of taxes, regulatory fees, surcharges or other fees that we are required to collect from you and must pay to any United States (federal, state or local) or foreign government, agency, commission or quasi-governmental body as a result of our provision of Skype paid products to you. These taxes are listed at www.skype.com/go/ustax. All prices for Skype paid products are inclusive of a charge for your product and a charge for taxes, unless otherwise stated. The charges payable for calling phones outside of a subscription consist of a connection fee (charged once per call) and a per-minute rate as set out at www.skype.com/go/allrates. Call charges will be deducted from your Skype Credit balance. Skype may change its calling rates at any time by posting such change at www.skype.com/go/allrates. The new rate will apply to your next call after publication of the new rates. Please check the latest rates before you make your call. Fractional call minutes and fractional cent charges will be rounded up to the next whole unit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may be entitled, under applicable law, to a refund, upon request, of any pre-paid subscription balance in the event you switch your Skype Number to another provider. x. Skype Credit. Skype does not guarantee that you will be able to use your Skype Credit balance to purchase all Skype paid products. If you do not use your Skype Credit for a period of 180 days, Skype will place your Skype Credit on inactive status. You can reactivate the Skype Credit by following the reactivation link at https://www.skype.com/go/store.reactivate.credit. You can enable the Auto Recharge feature when you buy Skype Credit by ticking the appropriate box. If enabled, your Skype Credit balance will be recharged with the same amount and by your chosen payment method every time your Skype balance goes below the threshold set by Skype from time to time. If you purchased a subscription with a payment method other than credit card, PayPal or Moneybookers (Skrill), and you have enabled Auto-Recharge, your Skype Credit balance will be recharged with the amount necessary to purchase your next recurring subscription. You can disable Auto-Recharge at any time by accessing and changing your settings in your account portal in Skype. If your Microsoft Account is closed, for any reason, any unused Skype credit associated with your Microsoft account will be lost and cannot be retrieved. xi. International Message Fees. GroupMe currently uses US-based numbers for each group created. Every text message sent to or received from a GroupMe number will count as an international text message sent to or received from the United States. Depending upon your location, Microsoft Teams may be using a phone number that could count as an international text message. Please check with your provider for the associated international rates.","Microsoft's communication services like Skype, Microsoft Teams, and GroupMe offer various functionalities with specific terms, including limited emergency call capabilities, adherence to fair use and broadcasting terms, and considerations for international message fees and Skype credit policies."
TikTok,Dispute Resolution,"A. Informal resolution process first. If we have a dispute with you relating to or arising out of these Terms, we will first try and resolve it with you amicably. You agree to do the same for us. To be clear, when we use the terms “TikTok,” “we,” or “us” in this Section 12.A, we mean TikTok Inc. and all of our affiliated companies and individuals. The party raising a dispute will initiate this process by notifying the other. Whichever party receives the notice will have 60 days to respond. If the dispute has not been resolved after the response time has expired, or within 30 days after a response has been issued, whichever is earlier, either party may file legal action against the other. Engaging in this informal dispute resolution process is a requirement that must be completed before filing any legal action. You and TikTok agree that you both will make a good faith effort to resolve the dispute amicably before either you or TikTok files any legal action against the other, and that the statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution process. B. Exclusive venue. These Terms and any claims, causes of action, of any kind or character, or demand arising out of or relating to the Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of California. Any claim, cause of action or dispute, arising out of or relating to these Terms shall also be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California or the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles. You also agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim. C. One year limitation period / limitation on legal action. YOU AND TIKTOK AGREE THAT YOU MUST INITIATE ANY PROCEEDING OR ACTION WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OF THE DATE OF THE OCCURRENCE OF THE EVENT OR FACTS GIVING RISE TO A DISPUTE THAT IS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS. OTHERWISE, YOU FOREVER WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PURSUE ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION, OF ANY KIND OR CHARACTER, BASED ON SUCH EVENTS OR FACTS, AND SUCH CLAIM(S) OR CAUSE(S) OF ACTION ARE PERMANENTLY BARRED.","TikTok requires trying to resolve disputes amicably before taking legal action, with a specified timeline for notification and response. Disputes not resolved informally within the set period may proceed to court. Legal claims related to TikTok's terms must be filed within one year from the dispute's occurrence, under California law, and are exclusively handled in specific California courts. Failure to initiate a claim within this timeframe results in a permanent waiver of rights to the claim."

Be sure to tell us the name of the person or company to whom the payment is scheduled to be made and the amount of the payment you wish to stop. If you call, we may also require you to put your request in writing and get it to us within 14 calendar days after you call. You will be charged for each stop-payment order you give in accordance with our current applicable schedule of services and fees. If a payment is made to the payee/merchant electronically, and the funds have already been deducted from your account, it is not possible to stop payment. Likewise, if payment is made to a payee/ merchant via check and the check has already been cashed by the payee/merchant, you may not stop payment. 2.

You understand that you may not place stop payment orders on any transfers originated by use of a card except for arrangements made with merchants or payees for recurring payments. Disclosure of right to receive notice of varying amounts If these regular payments may vary in amount, we or the person you are going to pay will tell you 10 days before each payment when it will be made and how much it will be. You may choose instead to get this notice only when the payment would differ by more than a certain amount from the previous payment, or when the amount would fall outside certain limits that you set. Disclosure of Bank’s liability for failure to make transfers If we do not complete a transfer to or from your account on time or in the correct amount in accordance with the General Provisions section below, we will be liable for your direct losses or damages.

If the transfer will go over the credit limit on your overdraft line, if you have one c. If the transfer will exceed the limitations on your savings or money market account d. If the ATM where you are making the transfer does not have enough cash e. If the terminal or system was not working properly and you knew about the breakdown when you started the transfer f. If circumstances beyond our control (such as interruption of telephone service or telecommunications facilities, fire or flood) prevent the transfer, despite reasonable precautions that we have taken g. If you have not provided us with complete and correct payment information, including without limitation the name, address, account number and payment amount for the payee on a bill payment h.

If we need more time, however, we may take up to 45 calendar  days, (for PIN point-of-sale transactions and/or Non-PIN transactions up to 90 calendar days) to investigate your complaint or question. If we decide to do this, we will provisionally credit your account within 10 business days (for verified unauthorized Non- PIN transactions, within five (5) business days) for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have the use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation.

PNC,ARBITRATION PROVISION,"READ THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION CAREFULLY: IT WILL IMPACT HOW LEGAL CLAIMS YOU AND WE HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED. Under the terms of this Arbitration Provision, and except as set forth below, Claims (as defined below) will be resolved by individual (and not classwide) binding arbitration in accordance with the terms specified herein, if you or we elect it. YOUR RIGHT TO OPT OUT; EFFECT OF ARBITRATION. This Arbitration Provision will apply to you and us and to your Account as of the date your Account was opened (or, if you are an existing customer, as of the date of this Agreement), unless you opt out by providing proper and timely notice as set forth below. If a Claim is arbitrated, neither you nor we will have the right to: (1) have a court or a jury decide the Claim; (2) engage in information-gathering (discovery) to the same extent as in court; (3) participate in a class action, private attorney general, or other representative action in court or in arbitration; or (4) join or consolidate a Claim with those of any other person. This Arbitration Provision will survive the termination of this Agreement. See further details below. Definitions “We,” “Us” and “Our.” Solely as used in this Arbitration Provision, the terms “we,” “us” and “our” also refer to (1) our employees, agents, officers, directors, parents, controlling persons, subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors, acquired entities, successors, and assigns; and (2) any failed bank to the extent of the assets acquired by us or our affiliates. “Account.” For purposes of this Arbitration Provision, “Account” refers to your personal deposit account or accounts with us and the features and services provided in connection with it or them. Personal deposit accounts include checking accounts, savings accounts, money market deposit accounts, and certificates of deposit.  Certificates of deposit and money market deposit accounts held in a retirement account are collectively an “Account.” “Account” also refers, collectively and separately, to the Spend, Reserve and Growth accounts in your Virtual Wallet, Virtual Wallet Student, Virtual Wallet with Performance Spend, Virtual Wallet with Performance Select, or Virtual Wallet Checking Pro. “Claim.” A “Claim” subject to arbitration is any demand, cause of action, complaint, claim, asserted right, or request for monetary or equitable relief, whether past, present, or future, and based upon any legal theory, including contract, tort, consumer protection law, fraud, statute, regulation, ordinance, or common law, which arises out of or relates to this Agreement, your Account or Accounts, the events leading up to your becoming an Account holder (for example, advertisements or promotions), any feature or service provided in connection with your Account or Accounts, or any transaction conducted with us related to any of your Accounts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term “Claim” excludes: (a) any dispute or controversy about the validity, enforceability, coverage, or scope of this Arbitration Provision or any part thereof, including the Class Action Waiver and Public Injunctive Relief Waiver below (a court will decide such disputes or controversies); and (b) any individual action brought by either party in small claims court or your state’s equivalent court, unless such action is transferred, removed, or appealed to a different court. After a Claim is filed with the arbitration administrator, but before an arbitrator is formally appointed to a Claim, a party may send a written notice to the opposing party and the administrator stating that the Claim is within the jurisdiction of small claims court (or an equivalent court) and requesting that that court decide the Claim. Upon receipt of that notice, the administrator will administratively close the case without requiring the payment of filing or any other administrative fees. Arbitration Procedures Electing Arbitration of Claims. Except if you opt out as provided below, you or we may elect to arbitrate any Claim. The election may be made by submitting a written Notice of Arbitration (“Notice”) in accordance with the terms herein. Or, if a lawsuit asserting a Claim is filed in court, the other party may elect arbitration in the lawsuit (for example, a motion by the defendant to compel arbitration). If you or we commence litigation of a Claim, neither you nor we waive our right to elect to arbitrate any counterclaim or other Claim that you or we may make. Notice Requirements.

The Notice must be clearly marked “Notice of Arbitration” and contain the claimant’s name, telephone number, mailing address, e-mail address, the Account number of any Account at issue, a description of the nature and basis of the dispute, the relief sought by the claimant, and the page 15 of 31 RDAOPM11-0224claimant’s signature. To safeguard your Account, if you have retained counsel to submit the Notice, your Notice must include your signed statement authorizing us to share information about the Account and the Claim with your counsel. The noticing party must provide the other party 45 days from receipt of the Notice in order to provide the parties a meaningful opportunity to resolve the dispute in an informal, prompt, mutually beneficial manner.  During this period, any applicable statutes of limitations or contractual limitations periods will be tolled. The arbitration administrator may not accept or administer an arbitration nor assess fees until the expiration of the 45-day period.  Either party may seek court intervention regarding the initiation of arbitration or the assessment of fees in connection with such arbitration. Arbitration administrator and rules. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (""AAA"") under its rules for consumer arbitrations.  The AAA rules and forms may be obtained by contacting AAA at 1-800-788-7879 or visiting www.adr.org .  AAA will apply its rules and codes of procedures in effect at the time arbitration is elected including, if applicable, AAA’s Supplementary Rules for Multiple Case Filings. If AAA is unable or unwilling to administer the arbitration in accordance with this Arbitration Provision, the parties may agree on another administrator or, if there is no agreement, a court with jurisdiction may appoint one. The arbitrator may, as appropriate, hold hearings in person, by telephone or videoconference, or decide Claims based on papers submitted by the parties. Any in-person arbitration hearing will take place in a venue in the county where you reside unless you and we agree otherwise. Arbitration costs. The parties shall pay filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees in accordance with the administrator’s rules, unless applicable law requires a different allocation.  This means that you will be responsible for paying your share of the administrator’s filing fees unless you obtain a waiver of fees from the administrator.  However, if you send us a written signed request at our Notice Address requesting that we pay your share of the fees and stating that you tried but were unable to obtain a fee waiver after submitting the documentation required by the administrator, and if your request is made in good faith, we will pay or reimburse you for your share of the filing fees charged by the administrator What law the arbitrator will apply. The arbitrator will not be bound by judicial rules of procedure and evidence that would apply in a court, or by state or local laws that relate to arbitration proceedings. However, the arbitrator will apply the same statutes of limitation, evidentiary privileges, and applicable substantive law that a court would apply if the matter were pending in court. The arbitrator may consider rulings in arbitrations involving other customers, but an arbitrator’s ruling will not be binding in proceedings involving different customers. In addition, the arbitrator has the same power as a federal court to impose sanctions against any represented party or counsel for any violation of the standards of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b) or 28 U.S.C. § 1927. The arbitrator’s decision and award. At the timely request of either party, the arbitrator shall provide a brief written explanation of the grounds for the decision. The arbitrator may award any damages or other relief or remedies (including statutory awards of attorneys’ fees) available under applicable law, as limited in the Class Action Waiver and Public Injunctive Relief Waiver below, in an individual action brought in court. If the arbitrator finds that you or we have violated the standards of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b) or 28 U.S.C. § 1927, if permitted by applicable law, the arbitrator may reallocate compensation, expenses, and administrative fees (which include filing and hearing fees) as justice requires. Effect of arbitration Award; appeal. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding on all parties, except for any right of judicial review provided by the Federal Arbitration Act. Federal Arbitration Act This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Provision. CLASS ACTION WAIVER If either you or we elect to arbitrate a Claim, neither you nor we will have the right: (a) to participate in a class action, private attorney general action or other representative action in court or in arbitration, either as a class representative or class member; or (b) to join or consolidate Claims with claims of any other persons (except for co-account owners). No arbitrator shall have authority to conduct any arbitration in violation of this provision or to issue any relief (including damages, restitution, or declaratory relief) that applies to any person or entity other than you and/or us individually. The parties acknowledge that this Class Action Waiver is material and essential to the arbitration of any Claims and is non-severable from this Arbitration Provision. If (after exhaustion of all appeals) a court finds that this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, then any non-arbitrable aspects of the Claims will proceed in court after all other arbitrable aspects of the Claims are arbitrated. The parties acknowledge and agree that under no circumstances will a class action be arbitrated. page 16 of 31 RDAOPM11-0224PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF WAIVER If either you or we elect to arbitrate a Claim, neither you nor we will have the right to seek a public injunction, if such a waiver is permitted by the FAA. If (after exhaustion of all appeals) a court decides that this Public Injunctive Relief Waiver is unenforceable, any request for a public injunction will be decided in court after all other Claims are arbitrated. In no event will an arbitrator be permitted to issue a public injunction. Conflicts; Severability; Survival In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this Arbitration Provision and the AAA rules, or any other terms of the Agreement, the provisions of this Arbitration Provision shall control.  If any part of this Arbitration Provision is deemed or found to be unenforceable for any reason, the remainder shall be enforceable, except as provided by the Class Action Waiver or Public Injunctive Relief Waiver. This Arbitration Provision shall survive (1) the closing of your Account and the termination of any relationship between us, including the termination of the Agreement, and (2) survive any bankruptcy to the extent consistent with applicable bankruptcy law. RIGHT TO OPT OUT You may opt out of arbitration by sending us a written notice (the “Opt Out Notice”). To be effective, an Opt Out Notice must (1) include the Account holder name, address, phone number, and Account number(s); (2) state that you are opting out of the Arbitration Provision in your Account Agreement for the listed Account numbers; (3) be sent to us at PNC Bank, Attn: Arbitration Opt Out, P.O. Box 535229, Pittsburgh, PA 15253-5229; (4) be signed personally by all account owners; and (5) be postmarked within forty-five (45) days after either (i) the date we first delivered or otherwise provided you with an arbitration provision, in paper or electronic form, or (ii) the day you open your Account, whichever is later. Your decision to opt out will not affect any other term in this Account Agreement. If the Arbitration Provision of your Account Agreement has already been delivered or otherwise made available to you, amendments to your Account Agreement will not give you a new right to opt out of this Arbitration Provision, unless we amend a substantive clause of the Arbitration Provision.","This detailed arbitration provision explains that any disputes or claims (""Claims"") arising out of or relating to the account agreement, the account, or any related transactions may be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, if either party elects to do so. The terms include a comprehensive definition of ""Claim"" and detailed procedures for initiating arbitration, including notice requirements and the selection of the arbitration administrator, which is the American Arbitration Association (AAA). The provision sets forth the costs associated with arbitration, the law applicable to the arbitration process, and how the arbitrator's decision and award will be handled. It also includes a Class Action Waiver, which prohibits participants from engaging in class actions, private attorney general actions, or other representative actions in both court and arbitration settings. Similarly, a Public Injunctive Relief Waiver restricts parties from seeking public injunctions through arbitration. The provision emphasizes the governing role of the Federal Arbitration Act in interpreting and enforcing the arbitration terms. It notes that certain aspects, such as the Class Action Waiver and Public Injunctive Relief Waiver, are fundamental and non-severable from the arbitration process, specifying the procedure should any part of the arbitration provision be deemed unenforceable. Finally, it states that the arbitration provision will survive the termination of the account agreement or any relationship between the parties and provides a clear opt-out procedure for account holders who do not wish to be bound by arbitration, requiring a written notice within a specified period."
