TikTok,Dispute Resolution,"A. Informal resolution process first. If we have a dispute with you relating to or arising out of these Terms, we will first try and resolve it with you amicably. You agree to do the same for us. To be clear, when we use the terms “TikTok,” “we,” or “us” in this Section 12.A, we mean TikTok Inc. and all of our affiliated companies and individuals. The party raising a dispute will initiate this process by notifying the other. Whichever party receives the notice will have 60 days to respond. If the dispute has not been resolved after the response time has expired, or within 30 days after a response has been issued, whichever is earlier, either party may file legal action against the other. Engaging in this informal dispute resolution process is a requirement that must be completed before filing any legal action. You and TikTok agree that you both will make a good faith effort to resolve the dispute amicably before either you or TikTok files any legal action against the other, and that the statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution process. B. Exclusive venue. These Terms and any claims, causes of action, of any kind or character, or demand arising out of or relating to the Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of California.

You also agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim. C. One year limitation period / limitation on legal action. YOU AND TIKTOK AGREE THAT YOU MUST INITIATE ANY PROCEEDING OR ACTION WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OF THE DATE OF THE OCCURRENCE OF THE EVENT OR FACTS GIVING RISE TO A DISPUTE THAT IS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS.

Disputes not resolved informally within the set period may proceed to court. Legal claims related to TikTok's terms must be filed within one year from the dispute's occurrence, under California law, and are exclusively handled in specific California courts. Failure to initiate a claim within this timeframe results in a permanent waiver of rights to the claim."
