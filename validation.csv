PNC,SUBSTITUTE CHECK POLICY DISCLOSURE,"SUBSTITUTE CHECKS AND YOUR RIGHTS (IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT CONSUMER CHECKING AND MONEY MARKET ACCOUNTS) What is a substitute check? To make check processing faster, federal law permits banks to replace original checks with “substitute checks.” These checks are similar in size to original checks with a slightly reduced image of the front and back of the original check. The front of a substitute check states: “This is a legal copy of your check. You can use it the same way you would use the original check.” You may use a substitute check as proof of payment just like the original check. Some or all of the checks that you receive back from us may be substitute checks. This notice describes rights you have when you receive substitute checks from us. The rights in this notice do not apply to original checks or to electronic debits to your account. However, you have rights under other law with respect to those transactions. What are my rights regarding substitute checks? In certain cases, federal law provides a special procedure that allows you to request a refund for losses you suffer if a substitute check is posted to your account (for example, if you think that we withdrew the wrong amount from your account or that we withdrew money from your account more than once for the same check). The losses you may attempt to recover under this procedure may include the amount that was withdrawn from your account and fees that were charged as a result of the withdrawal (for example, overdraft fees). The amount of your refund under this procedure is limited to the amount of your loss or the amount of the substitute check, whichever is less. You also are entitled to interest on the amount of your refund if your account is an interestbearing account. If your loss exceeds the amount of the substitute check, you may be able to recover additional amounts under other law. If you use this procedure, you may receive up to $2,500 of your refund (plus interest if your account earns interest) within 10 business days after we received your claim and the remainder of your refund (plus interest if your account earns interest) not later than 45 calendar days after we received your claim. We may reverse the refund (including any interest on the refund) if we later are able to demonstrate that the substitute check was correctly posted to your account. page 17 of 31 RDAOPM11-0224How do I make a claim for a refund? If you believe that you have suffered a loss relating to a substitute check that you received and that was posted to your account, please contact us: ● By phone at 1-888-PNC-BANK (1-888-762-2265). For our  Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Customers PNC accepts Telecommunications Relay Service (TRS) calls. ● Write us at: PNC Bank/Adjustments, P7-PFSC-02-C, 500 First Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15219 ● Or contact us via Online Banking or the Mobile Banking App. You must contact us within 40 calendar days of the date that we mailed (or otherwise delivered by a means to which you agreed) the substitute check in question or the account statement showing that the substitute check was posted to your account, whichever is later. We will extend this time period if you were not able to make a timely claim because of extraordinary circumstances. If you tell us orally, we may require that you send us your claim in writing within 10 business days. Your claim must include: ● A description of why you have suffered a loss (for example, you think the amount withdrawn was incorrect); ● An estimate of the amount of your loss; ● An explanation of why the substitute check you received is insufficient to confirm that you suffered a loss; and ● A copy of the substitute check or the following information to help us identify the substitute check: account number, check number, amount of the check, date the check was paid or posted to your account, the reference number for the check (if known), name of the person to whom you wrote the check, and any other pertinent information.","This notice explains your rights regarding substitute checks in consumer checking and money market accounts. A substitute check is a paper reproduction of an original check that federal law allows banks to use to make check processing faster. It is similar in size to an original check with a slightly reduced image of both the front and back of the original check. The front of a substitute check states it is a legal copy that can be used the same way as the original check. You have specific rights when you receive substitute checks from your bank. If you believe a substitute check was incorrectly posted to your account, causing a loss (for example, incorrect withdrawal amount or a double withdrawal), you can request a refund. The procedure to request a refund includes a special federal law process, which might allow you to recover losses including withdrawn amounts and associated fees like overdraft fees. The refund you can get through this process is capped at the lesser of your actual loss or the amount of the substitute check, but you might recover additional amounts under other laws for losses exceeding the substitute check's amount. To initiate a refund request, you must contact the bank within 40 calendar days from when you received the substitute check or the account statement showing the check was posted, whichever is later. The notice provides contact information for PNC Bank, including phone numbers, a mailing address, and options to contact through online or mobile banking. When making a claim, you must provide a detailed description of the loss, an estimate of the loss amount, why the substitute check is insufficient to confirm the loss, and a copy of the substitute check or information to help identify it. The bank may require written confirmation of claims initially made orally within 10 business days. If your claim is valid, you could receive up to $2,500 of your refund (plus interest, if applicable) within 10 business days after the bank receives your claim, with any remaining refund (plus interest) provided no later than 45 calendar days after the claim was received. The bank can reverse the refund if it later proves the substitute check was correctly posted. Extraordinary circumstances that prevent a timely claim may extend the 40-day period."

Microsoft,Store,"Store. ""Store"" refers to a Service that allows you to browse, download, purchase, and rate and review applications (the term ""application"" includes games) and other digital content. These Terms cover use of certain Stores owned or operated by Microsoft or its affiliates (including, but not limited to, the Office Store, Microsoft Store on Xbox and Microsoft Store on Windows). ""Office Store"" means a Store for Office products and apps for Office, Microsoft 365, SharePoint, Exchange, Access and Project (2013 versions or later), or any other experience that is branded Office Store. ""Microsoft Store on Windows"" means a Store, owned and operated by Microsoft or its affiliates, for Windows devices such as phone, PC and tablet, or any other experience that is branded Microsoft Store and accessible on Windows devices such as phone, PC, or tablet. ""Microsoft Store on Xbox"" means a Store owned and operated by Microsoft or its affiliates and made available on Xbox consoles, or any other experience that is branded Microsoft Store and made available on an Xbox console. i. License Terms. We will identify the publisher of each application available in the relevant Store. Unless different license terms are provided with the application, the Standard Application License Terms (""SALT"") at the end of these Terms are an agreement between you and the application publisher setting forth the license terms that apply to an application you download through any Store owned or operated by Microsoft or its affiliates (excluding the Office Store). For clarity, these Terms cover the use of, and services provided by, Microsoft Services. Section 5 of these Terms also applies to any Third-Party Apps and Services acquired through a Store. Applications downloaded through the Office Store are not governed by the SALT and have separate license terms that apply. ii. Updates. Microsoft will automatically check for and download updates to your applications, even if you’re not signed into the relevant Store. You can change your Store or system settings if you prefer not to receive automatic updates to Store applications. However, certain Office Store applications that are entirely or partly hosted online may be updated at any time by the application developer and may not require your permission to update. iii. Ratings and Reviews. If you rate or review an application or other Digital Good in the Store, you may receive email from Microsoft containing content from the publisher of the application or Digital Good. Any such email comes from Microsoft; we do not share your email address with publishers of applications or other Digital Goods you acquire through the Store. iv. Safety Warning. To avoid possible injury, discomfort or eye strain, you should take periodic breaks from use of games or other applications, especially if you feel any pain or fatigue resulting from usage. If you experience discomfort, take a break. Discomfort might include feelings of nausea, motion sickness, dizziness, disorientation, headache, fatigue, eye strain, or dry eyes. Using applications can distract you and obstruct your surroundings. Avoid trip hazards, stairs, low ceilings, fragile or valuable items that could be damaged. A very small percentage of people may experience seizures when exposed to certain visual images like flashing lights or patterns that may appear in applications. Even people with no history of seizures may have an undiagnosed condition that can cause these seizures. Symptoms may include lightheadedness, altered vision, twitching, jerking or shaking of limbs, disorientation, confusion, loss of consciousness, or convulsions. Immediately stop using and consult a doctor if you experience any of these symptoms, or consult a doctor before using the applications if you’ve ever suffered symptoms linked to seizures. Parents should monitor their children’s use of applications for signs of symptoms.","The ""Store"" refers to Microsoft's platform allowing users to browse, download, purchase, rate, and review applications and digital content. It encompasses the Office Store (for Office products and apps), the Microsoft Store on Windows (for Windows devices), and the Microsoft Store on Xbox (for Xbox consoles). License Terms: Application licenses in the Store are generally governed by the Standard Application License Terms (SALT), except for those from the Office Store, which have separate terms. Updates: Microsoft automatically updates applications, with users able to modify settings to control this process. Office Store apps, especially those hosted online, may update without user intervention. Ratings and Reviews: Submitting ratings or reviews may lead to receiving emails from Microsoft but not from application publishers directly, as Microsoft does not share user emails with them. Safety Warning: Users are advised to take breaks when using applications to avoid discomfort or injury, with specific warnings about the potential for seizures from certain visual images and recommendations for consulting a doctor if necessary. These guidelines emphasize safe, informed usage of the Store's offerings and respect for intellectual property rights."

Microsoft,Using the Services & Support,"Using the Services & Support. a. Microsoft account. You’ll need a Microsoft account to access many of the Services. Your Microsoft account lets you sign in to products, websites and services provided by Microsoft and some Microsoft partners. i. Creating an Account. You can create a Microsoft account by signing up online. You agree not to use any false, inaccurate or misleading information when signing up for your Microsoft account. In some cases, a third party, like your Internet service provider, may have assigned a Microsoft account to you. If you received your Microsoft account from a third party, the third party may have additional rights over your account, like the ability to access or delete your Microsoft account. Please review any additional terms the third party provided you, as Microsoft has no responsibility regarding these additional terms. If you create a Microsoft account on behalf of an entity, such as your business or employer, you represent that you have the legal authority to bind that entity to these Terms. You cannot transfer your Microsoft account credentials to another user or entity. To protect your account, keep your account details and password confidential. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Microsoft account. ii. Account Use. You must use your Microsoft account to keep it active. This means you must sign in at least once in a two-year period to keep your Microsoft account, and associated Services, active, unless a longer period is provided in the Microsoft account activity policy at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2086738 or in an offer for a paid portion of the Services. If you don’t sign in during this time, we will assume your Microsoft account is inactive and will close it for you. Please see section 4.a.iv.2 for the consequences of a closed Microsoft account. You must sign into your Outlook.com inbox and your OneDrive (separately) at least once in a one-year period, otherwise we will close your Outlook.com inbox and your OneDrive for you. If we reasonably suspect that your Microsoft account is at risk of being used by a third party fraudulently (for example, as a result of an account compromise), Microsoft may suspend your account until you can reclaim ownership. Based on the nature of the compromise, we may be required to disable access to some or all of Your Content. If you are having trouble accessing your Microsoft account, please visit this website: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=238656. iii. Kids and Accounts. By creating a Microsoft account or using the Services, you accept and agree to be bound by these Terms and represent that you have either reached the age of ""majority"" where you live or your parent or legal guardian agrees to be bound by these Terms on your behalf. If you do not know whether you have reached the age of majority where you live, or do not understand this section, please ask your parent or legal guardian for help. If you are the parent or legal guardian of a minor, you and the minor accept and agree to be bound by these Terms and are responsible for all use of the Microsoft account or Services, including purchases, whether the minor’s account is now open or created later. iv. Closing Your Account. 1. You can cancel specific Services or close your Microsoft account at any time and for any reason. To close your Microsoft account, please visit https://account.live.com/closeaccount.aspx. When you ask us to close your Microsoft account, you can choose to put it in a suspended state for either 30 or 60 days just in case you change your mind. After that 30- or 60-day period, your Microsoft account will be closed. Please see section 4.a.iv.2 below for an explanation as to what happens when your Microsoft account is closed. Logging back in during the suspension period will reactivate your Microsoft account. 2. If your Microsoft account is closed (whether by you or us), a few things happen. First, your right to use the Microsoft account to access the Services stops immediately. Second, we’ll delete Data or Your Content associated with your Microsoft account or will otherwise disassociate it from you and your Microsoft account (unless we are required by law to keep it, return it, or transfer it to you or a third party identified by you). You should have a regular backup plan as Microsoft won’t be able to retrieve Your Content or Data once your account is closed. Third, you may lose access to products you’ve acquired. b. Moderation and Enforcement. Many of our Services that allow you to interact, create, generate, and share content with others leverage safety systems to protect our Services and other users. i. Policies. Our Code of Conduct identifies what’s prohibited when using our Services. Specific Services have additional policies and community standards applicable to their users, which are available here (https://aka.ms/trustandsafety). ii. Reporting a Concern. You can report concerning content or conduct that may violate our Code of Conduct here (https://aka.ms/reportconcerns). iii. Review. Where applicable, we may use automated systems and humans to review content to identify suspected spam, viruses, fraud, phishing, malware, jailbreaking, or other illegal or harmful content or conduct. iv. Enforcement. We reserve the right to deny content if it exceeds limits on storage or file size allowed by the Service. We may block, remove or decline to display content if it appears to violate our Code of Conduct or another Service policy or where required by law. If you violate these terms or Service-Specific Terms, we may take action against your account. This could include limiting access to certain features or Services, stopping providing Services, closing your Microsoft account immediately or blocking delivery of a communication (like email, file sharing or instant message) to or from the Services. Closure of your access to a Service or your account may result in forfeiture of content licenses, associated content, memberships, and Microsoft account balances associated with the account. When reviewing alleged violations of these Terms, Microsoft reserves the right to review content to resolve the issue. However, we cannot monitor the entire Services and make no attempt to do so. For more information about the moderation and enforcement processes, Service specific terms and appeals, see https://aka.ms/trustandsafety. Information about our policy relating to claims of intellectual property infringement may be found at NOTICES. c. Work or School Accounts.

If you do, you agree that the owner of the domain associated with your email address may be notified of the existence of your Microsoft account and its associated subscriptions, control and administer your account, and access and process your Data, including the contents of your communications and files, and that Microsoft may notify the owner of the domain if the account or Data is compromised. You further agree that your use of the Microsoft services may be subject to the agreements Microsoft has with you or your organization and these Terms may not apply. If you already have a Microsoft account and you use a separate work or school email address to access Services covered under these Terms, you may be prompted to update the email address associated with your Microsoft account in order to continue accessing such Services. d. Additional Equipment/Data Plans. To use many of the Services, you’ll need an internet connection and/or data/cellular plan. You might also need additional equipment, like a headset, camera or microphone. You are responsible for providing all connections, plans, and equipment needed to use the Services and for paying the fees charged by the provider(s) of your connections, plans, and equipment. Those fees are in addition to any fees you pay us for the Services and we will not reimburse you for such fees. Check with your provider(s) to determine if there are any such fees that may apply to you. e. Service Notifications. When there’s something we need to tell you about a Service you use, we’ll send you Service notifications. If you gave us your email address or phone number in connection with your Microsoft account, then we may send Service notifications to you via email or via SMS (text message), including to verify your identity before registering your mobile phone number and verifying your purchases. We may also send you Service notifications by other means (for example by in-product messages). Data or messaging rates may apply when receiving notifications via SMS. f. Support. Customer support for some Services is available at https://support.microsoft.com. Certain Services may offer separate or additional customer support, subject to the terms available at https://microsoft.com/support-service-agreement, unless otherwise specified. Support may not be available for preview or beta versions of features or Services. g. Ending your Services. If your Services are canceled (whether by you or us), first your right to access the Services stops immediately and your license to the software related to the Services ends. Second, we’ll delete Data or Your Content associated with your Service or will otherwise disassociate it from you and your Microsoft account (unless we are required by law to keep it, return it, or transfer it to you or a third party identified by you). As a result you may no longer be able to access any of the Services (or Your Content that you’ve stored on those Services). You should have a regular backup plan. Third, you may lose access to products you’ve acquired. If you have canceled your Microsoft account and have no other account able to access the Services your Services may be canceled immediately.","To use Microsoft Services, a Microsoft account is necessary, which allows access to various products and services. Users must provide accurate information when creating an account, which they cannot transfer, and they are responsible for all activity under their account. Regular sign-ins are required to keep the account active; otherwise, it may be closed. Microsoft reserves the right to suspend accounts at risk of unauthorized use, potentially affecting content access. Parents or guardians agree to these terms for minors. Accounts can be closed by the user, with specific consequences for the data and content associated with the account. Microsoft employs moderation and enforcement mechanisms to protect its services and users, including content review and actions against accounts violating terms. Work or school accounts are subject to additional controls by the domain owner. Using services may require additional equipment or data plans, for which the user is responsible. Notifications and support are provided through various channels, and ending services can result in loss of access to services and data, emphasizing the importance of backup plans."
