            "Samsung Business Services Terms and Conditions (USA) The sale and performance of Samsung Business Services is governed by these Samsung Business Services Terms and Conditions (the \"Terms and Conditions\"). The Terms and Conditions apply to all: 1) enterprise purchases of Services (as defined below) directly from Samsung; and 2) enterprise purchases of Services through an authorized Samsung reseller or distributor (“reseller”). By placing your Order (as defined below) for the Services, receiving delivery of the Services, utilizing the Services, or clicking/checking any “I Agree” button or box or similar on the Samsung Business Services website in connection with your purchase, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. These Terms and Conditions are agreed between (i) you, either individually if you are agreeing to it in your own capacity, or if you are authorized to agree to these terms on behalf of your company or another entity, between the entity for whose benefit you act (in either case, \"you\", “your” or \"Customer\"), and (ii) Samsung Electronics America, Inc. (“Samsung”). The Services and Deliverables are solely for your internal business use unless permitted by Samsung in writing. If you purchased Services through a reseller, final prices and sales terms will be between you and the reseller; however, these Terms and Conditions apply to Samsung's provision of the Services to you. Section 3 below sets forth the payment terms that apply to you if Services are purchased directly from Samsung. Capitalized terms used but not defined in these Terms and Conditions shall have the meanings as set forth in the applicable Order. 1. Service Descriptions. As used herein, “Services” means each Samsung enterprise service offering as described in a service guide (each, a “Samsung Service Guide”) or an Order. Each Samsung Service Guide or Order describes: (i) available service options; (ii) specific projects, tasks, functions, responsibilities and services to be furnished by Samsung to Customer; (iii) deliverables to be provided (the “Deliverables”); (iv) assumptions, conditions and dependencies impacting the Services or upon which the pricing or delivery of the Services might be based; (v) the charges and expenses for the Services (“Fees”); (vi) additional terms and conditions that apply to the particular Services (for example, service levels, performance requirements, milestones, project plans, acceptance testing, and license rights for Deliverables); and (vii) the duration of the Services (the “Service Term”). 2. Services. On the Service Start Date (as defined below), Samsung shall commence providing Customer with the Services set forth in the Order, and Customer shall commence with the performance of its obligations thereunder. Unless otherwise set forth in an Order, Customer’s acceptance of the Services occurs upon performance of the Services by Samsung. A. Services Manager. All communications regarding any Order shall be directed to the applicable Customer or Samsung contacts. The Samsung and Customer contacts shall have the authority to act on behalf of the respective party in all day-to-day matters pertaining to the applicable Order, but shall not have the authority, through action, inaction or otherwise, to amend or modify these Terms and Conditions or an Order. Either party may change its designated contact upon written notice to the other party. B. Service Locations. Samsung may provide the Services (or portions thereof) from any location determined by Samsung or relocate the provision of the Services (or any portion thereof). C. Access & Use. Customer acknowledges that it is responsible (administratively and financially) for obtaining all required approvals, licenses, authorizations, consents, and permits for Samsung to use or access the Customer sites or Customer contractor sites, with such sites being kept free of health and safety hazards. D. Changes to Scope of Services. If the applicable Samsung Service Guide or Order permits change requests, either Samsung or Customer may request changes to the then existing scope of Services or Deliverables, including new or additional services, in accordance with the following change control procedures. All change requests will: (i) be in writing; (ii) have a description of the requested change; (iii) describe the purpose for the change; (iv) determine the priority of the change; (v) reflect the date of requested implementation; (vi) identify the pricing impact of the change, if any; and (vii) give the name of the individual authorized to request such changes. Changes requested will be reviewed by the receiving party as soon as possible, and all changes mutually agreed to by the parties will become effective upon the date set forth in the document executed by both parties describing such changes. E. Customer Obligations. Customer acknowledges that the ability of Samsung to provide certain Services and Deliverables in accordance with these Terms and Conditions and the associated Service Guide or Order (including the agreed pricing and delivery models) are contingent upon, and Customer represents, warrants and covenants that: (i) the Customer Materials (as defined below) provided by Customer shall be accurate, complete and accessible in the manner and in the format required by Samsung; and (ii) Customer will cooperate and provide timely performance of its obligations. In the event any Customer Materials are found to be inaccurate, incomplete or not properly accessible or formatted, or Customer fails to perform its obligations, in addition to Section 2(G) below, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith equitable changes to the impacted Order, which may include, without limitation, changes to the Fees charged to Customer. Customer is responsible for completing and maintaining a backup of all existing data, content, programs and Samsung will have no liability for loss or recovery of data or programs, or loss of use of systems arising out of the Services. F. If you have ordered a Samsung technical support services offering, Samsung will provide Customer’s Named Callers (as defined in the applicable service guide) with log-in credentials for access to Samsung’s Support Portal for the purposes of creating and tracking Customer support requests (the “Support Portal”). Customer agrees not to: (i) license, sublicense, sell, resell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, distribute, time share or otherwise commercially exploit or make the Support Portal available to any third party, other than the Named Callers; (ii) modify, adapt, or otherwise attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Support Portal or related systems or networks; (iii) use the Support Portal in any unlawful manner; (iv) use the Support Portal in any manner that interferes with or disrupts the integrity or performance of the Services and its components; (v) attempt to decipher, decompile, reverse engineer or otherwise discover the source code of any software making up the Support Portal; (vi) use the Support Portal to store or transmit any “protected health information” as that term is defined in 45 C.F.R. 160.103 or sensitive financial information, such as credit card numbers, social security numbers (or other national identifiers) and banking information; or (vii) use the Support Portal to knowingly post, transmit, upload, link to, send or store any viruses, malware, Trojan horses, time bombs, or any other similar harmful software. Samsung may suspend Customer’s access to the Support Portal if Samsung becomes aware of any non-compliance with the foregoing provisions and Samsung shall not be liable to Customer or any other third party for any such suspension or discontinuation of Customer’s access and use of the Support Portal. G. Savings Clause. The failure or delay of Samsung in its performance of its obligations under these Terms and Conditions or any Order is excused to the extent such failure is a result of: (i) any act or omission of Customer or any entity or individual acting on Customer’s behalf including Customer’s failure to perform (or cause to be performed) its obligations hereunder, (ii) unavailability of Customer’s materials or systems, including those provided by third parties, (iii) the reliance of Samsung on instructions, authorizations, approvals or other information from Customer’s representative(s); or (iv) any act or omission of a third party not under the control of Samsung. Samsung will use commercially reasonable efforts to perform the Services and provide the Deliverables notwithstanding such circumstances, and Customer agrees to reimburse Samsung for any additional charges and expenses incurred as a result of such efforts. H. Subcontracting. Samsung may, at its option and in its sole discretion, subcontract all or any part of its obligations under any Order (including to an Affiliate of Samsung). In the event that Samsung subcontracts any of its obligations, Samsung shall be responsible and liable for any such subcontractor or subcontractor personnel performance to the same extent as if such obligations were performed by Samsung or Samsung employees. For the purposes of these Terms and Conditions, an “Affiliate” of a party means an entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with that party. “Control” means direct or indirect control of fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting power to elect directors thereof, or for any other entity, the power to direct the management of such entity. I. Insurance. Samsung and Customer shall each maintain insurance in commercially reasonable amounts to protect itself and the other party from any and all claims for damage to property or personal injury (including death) made by anyone, that may arise from the Services performed under these Terms and Conditions.3. Ordering, Cost and Payment. For Orders placed with a reseller, Customer will receive an invoice directly from reseller and Sections 3. C. and 3. G. will not apply. A. \"Order\" means the submission of a Customer purchase order to Samsung or a reseller that references and incorporates a Samsung quote, Samsung Service Guide, order acknowledgement, order form, service schedule, statement of work, Services SKU or any other mutually-agreed form of order (including those accessible by URL), together with these Terms and Conditions. No pre-written terms of your purchase order will be binding on Samsung. After receipt of your Order, Samsung will provide you with a scheduled date for the start of the Services (the “Service Start Date”). Your Order is considered binding by Samsung and non-cancellable by you once Samsung has provided you with a Service Start Date. The parties may enter into one or more Orders and each Order is independent from any other Order. Quoted prices are effective until the expiration date of the Samsung quote. Samsung reserves the right, for any reason or for no reason whatsoever, to reject any Order received from Customer. Samsung may revise or discontinue Services at any time without penalty, including after Customer places an Order, but prior to the Service Start Date. B. Payment. Customer shall pay Samsung the fees as set forth in the applicable Order (“Fees”). Any increases in the Fees or cost of conducting the Services or providing the Deliverables incurred by reason of a Customer request for a change in scope or modification of the Services or Deliverables shall be borne by Customer. C. Invoices; Payment Terms. Samsung shall issue invoices in accordance with the Order. Customer shall pay all amounts due under an Order within thirty (30) days after the date of the applicable invoice. D. Late Payments. Payment terms shall be strictly enforced, and late payments shall be assessed monthly interest at the lesser of one and one-half percent (1.5%) or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law. Should Customer fail to make timely payments under an Order, Samsung may, at its discretion, suspend further performance of all Services, without limiting any other remedies it may have pursuant to these Terms and Conditions. If Customer fails to pay any due and payable amounts within ten (10) days after receipt of Samsung’s written notice that such amounts are past due, Customer shall be deemed to be in material breach hereunder and Samsung may immediately terminate any Order and pursue all other remedies. Should it become necessary to institute collection proceedings for amounts invoiced to Customer and unpaid following the applicable due date, Customer shall pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Samsung in connection with such proceedings, including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees, without regard to whether a suit is filed by Samsung. E. Travel and Lodging. Unless otherwise agreed in the applicable Order, the Fees are exclusive of any travel, lodging or other living expenses incurred in Samsung’s provision of the Services. Customer shall promptly reimburse Samsung for Samsung’s reasonable expenses actually incurred in the performance of the Services hereunder upon Samsung’s presentation to Customer of reasonable documentation evidencing such expenses. F. Taxes. All costs shall be paid in US Dollars and shall be exclusive of taxes. Any taxes, duties, excises or tariffs imposed on Fees paid in respect of an Order shall be the responsibility of Customer notwithstanding any change in law, policy or tax rate impacting the amount of taxes required to be remitted in connection with an invoice referred to in Section 3(C); provided, however, that Customer shall have no responsibility for taxes calculated solely by reference to the net income of Samsung. If Samsung is required by law to directly pay any taxes, fees, excises, tariffs or other charges for which Customer has responsibility pursuant to this Section 3(F), Customer shall promptly reimburse Samsung upon Samsung’s presentation to Customer of documentation evidencing such payment. G. Credit. Samsung may, in its sole discretion, agree to extend credit to Customer. Customer shall comply with Samsung’s policies and procedures regarding the extension of credit to customers. Samsung may revoke or reduce credit approval at any time without prior notice. Customer shall complete a Samsung credit application and if requested, provide financial statements prior to Samsung’s execution of any Order. In the event that Samsung, in its sole discretion, does not approve Customer’s credit, Samsung may elect to grant payment terms of cash in advance or some other agreed upon fully secured option such as a stand-by letter of credit, or such other terms as Samsung shall determine. 4. Certain Representations, Warranties and Covenants of Customer. As of the date of each Order hereunder: A. Formation; Authority. Customer represents, warrants and covenants that: it is duly formed, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state of its formation; it has all requisite power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under these Terms and Conditions and any Order, and any executed modification thereof; its performance under these Terms and Conditions and any Order have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action; and that these Terms and Conditions together with the Order constitutes the legal, valid and binding agreement of Customer, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms. B. Anti-Bribery. Customer represents, warrants and covenants that it is fully aware of and will comply with, and will not take any action or omit to take any action that would cause either Customer or Samsung to be in violation of, (i) the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act, or the India Prevention of Corruption Act of 1988, (ii) any other applicable anti-corruption laws, or (iii) any regulations promulgated under any such laws. Customer represents, warrants and covenants that neither it nor any of its employees is an official or employee of any government (or any department, agency or instrumentality of any government), political party, state owned enterprise or a public international organization such as the United Nations, or a representative or any such person (each, an “Official”). Customer further represents, warrants and covenants that, to its knowledge, neither it nor any of its employees has offered, promised, made or authorized to be made, or provided any contribution, thing of value or gift, or any other type of payment to, or for the private use of, directly or indirectly, any Official for the purpose of influencing or inducing any act or decision of the Official to secure an improper advantage in connection with, or in any way relating to, (A) any government authorization or approval involving Samsung, or (B) the obtaining or retention of business by Samsung. Customer further represents, warrants and covenants that it will not in the future offer, promise, make or otherwise allow to be made or provide any such payment and that it will take all lawful and necessary actions to ensure that no such payment is promised, made or provided in the future by any of its employees. If Customer does not abide with any of the above mentioned representations, warranties, or covenants, then Samsung shall reserve its right to terminate all Orders immediately without any prior notice or penalty, in addition to any other remedies available to it at law and/or in equity. C. Customer Materials. Customer represents, warrants and covenants that: (i) it possesses all necessary rights and licenses to all information, data, intellectual property, software, services, systems, facilities or other materials it provides to Samsung under an Order (collectively, “Customer Materials”); (ii) Samsung’s use of any Customer Materials does not contravene, violate or conflict with any other agreement to which Customer or any other applicable party that is the owner of, or has any right to, a particular Customer Material is a party; and (iii) Samsung’s use of any Customer Materials in connection with performing its obligations under these Terms and Conditions or an Order (including, but not limited to incorporating, including or embedding Customer Materials into, or using Customer Materials in connection with creating any Deliverables) does not infringe, misappropriate or violate any third party right; and (iv) if any Customer Materials include or make use of any free, open source or other publicly available software (“FOSS”) and such Customer Materials are to be embedded in or used in conjunction with a Deliverable, Customer will provide Samsung with a complete and accurate list of such FOSS, including a copy of the applicable FOSS licenses and copyright notices. D. Customer Business. Customer represents, warrants and covenants that its business (including Customer’s use of the Services and/or Deliverables as permitted in these Terms and Conditions) is operated in strict compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws, rules, regulations, directives and governmental requirements (including all applicable privacy and data protection laws) currently in effect and as they become effective. 5. Limited Warranties. A. Samsung Warranty. Samsung warrants to Customer that all Services (i) shall be performed in a professional and workmanlike manner in accordance with reasonable standards of the industry; and (ii) shall conform in all material respects to the written specifications set forth in the applicable Samsung Service Guide at the time of performance. Customer’s sole remedy for any breach of the warranty provided in this Section 5.A or any warrantyrelated to the Services provided in any Order shall be re-performance of any Services found to be defective thereunder. B. Disclaimer of Warranties. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION 5 WITH RESPECT TO SERVICES OR IN AN ORDER, SAMSUNG PROVIDES THE SERVICES AND DELIVERABLES ON AN “AS IS,” “WHERE IS” BASIS AND MAKES NO OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE SERVICES OR DELIVERABLES, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. FURTHER, SAMSUNG DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES OR DELIVERABLES WILL MEET CUSTOMER’S REQUIREMENTS OR ANY LEGAL OR OTHER REQUIREMENTS, OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SERVICES OR DELIVERABLES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. 6. Confidentiality. A. Definition of Confidential Information. “Confidential Information” shall mean all business information, technical data or know-how, in whatever form, which the disclosing party (the “Discloser”) transmits to the receiving party (the “Recipient”) in any manner relating to the properties, business activities or operations of Discloser, including (i); all information of Discloser that is not known to the public, without regard to the form in which such information is disclosed; (ii) any and all of the foregoing which is prepared by Recipient or its employees or agents that contains, reflects or is based upon, in whole or in part, any of the Confidential Information; and (iii) the contents of discussions and negotiations between the parties concerning the Services or Deliverables. Confidential Information shall not include information that Recipient can demonstrate: (A) is or (through no improper action or inaction by Recipient or any affiliate, agent, consultant or employee of Recipient) becomes part of the public domain; (B) was lawfully in the possession of or known by Recipient on a non-confidential basis at the time of disclosure by Discloser; (C) was received on a non-confidential basis from a third party having a lawful right to disclose such information; or (D) was independently developed by Recipient without reference to or use of the Confidential Information of Discloser as demonstrated by Recipient’s records. B. Non-Disclosure and Use. Recipient agrees to keep confidential and not to use the Confidential Information of Discloser for any purpose other than in furtherance of the performance or receipt of the Services, or with respect to Samsung as Recipient, the provision of the Services or Deliverables. Recipient shall not disclose Discloser’s Confidential Information to any person or entity other than Recipient’s employees, agents, advisors, subcontractors, and service providers and representatives with a need to know the Confidential Information in order to carry out the purpose contemplated by these Terms and Conditions and who agree to be bound by Recipient’s obligations under these Terms and Conditions with regard to nondisclosure and use of such Confidential Information. Recipient will not (and will cause its employees, Affiliates or agents not to) reverse-engineer, decompile or disassemble any part of, or remove any proprietary marking from, Discloser’s Confidential Information. C. Care. Recipient shall use at least the same degree of care to safeguard and to prevent disclosure to third parties of Confidential Information as it employs to safeguard its own information of a similar nature, but in no event less than reasonable care. Recipient shall promptly (i) notify Discloser in writing of the details and circumstances of any unauthorized disclosure, misuse or misappropriation of any of Discloser’s Confidential Information (an “Unauthorized Use”) which may come to Recipient’s attention; (ii) use best efforts to rectify or cure such Unauthorized Use and retrieve any such disclosed Confidential Information; and (iii) use best efforts to provide assistance to and cooperate with Discloser to rectify or cure such Unauthorized Use and to prevent further misuse or disclosure of such Confidential Information. D. Mandatory Disclosure. If Recipient becomes legally compelled to disclose any of Discloser’s Confidential Information, Recipient shall (i) promptly notify Discloser of such requirement before any disclosure is made so that Discloser may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy limiting disclosure or use of such information; and (ii) provide reasonable assistance to Discloser to seek such remedy at Discloser’s expense. If such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, Recipient may furnish only that portion of such Confidential Information that, in the written opinion of its legal counsel, it is legally required to disclose, and Recipient agrees to make commercially reasonable efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to the Confidential Information. E. Ownership; No Rights Granted. Discloser will retain the title and full ownership rights to its Confidential Information. No license, express or implied, in the Confidential Information is granted to Recipient other than to use the information in the manner and to the extent expressly authorized herein. F. Return of Confidential Information. Upon the written request of Discloser, all of Discloser’s Confidential Information in tangible form shall be, at Discloser’s sole discretion, either promptly returned to Discloser or promptly destroyed by Recipient, and in either case not retained by Recipient or its Affiliates in any form; provided, however, if Confidential Information cannot be purged from Recipient’s information or communications systems using commercially reasonable efforts, Recipient shall suppress such Confidential Information and allow it to be accessible only to Recipient’s employees with administrative privileges who shall be subject to a confidentiality obligation to Recipient at least as protective as those contained in these Terms and Conditions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Recipient’s legal department may retain an archival copy of all or any portion of Discloser’s Confidential Information to the extent required by applicable law or regulation or for the purpose of defending or prosecuting claims relating to these Terms and Conditions. The rights and obligations of the parties regarding the non-disclosure and use of Confidential Information exchanged under these Terms and Conditions will survive any return, retention or destruction of any Confidential Information. G. Remedies. The parties acknowledge and agree that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Section 6, and that any such breach may cause immediate and irreparable harm. Accordingly, each party agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of this Section 6 by Recipient, Discloser shall be entitled to seek, in addition to all remedies otherwise available at law or in equity, injunctive relief. 7.

License to Samsung. Customer grants to Samsung a non- exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual, royalty-free, sub-licensable and transferable right and license to use, copy, make derivative works of, distribute, display, sublicense any Customer Materials solely to the extent necessary for Samsung to provide the Services and Deliverables under these Terms and Conditions and any Order.

D. Use of FOSS. Customer agrees that as part of a Deliverable, Samsung may make use of FOSS. If so, Samsung will include in the applicable Order a list of such FOSS, including notice of the associated FOSS license(s) and terms as of its delivery to Customer as part of a Deliverable. CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ITS USE AND DISTRIBUTION OF ANY SUCH FOSS IS SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE FOSS LICENSE(S), AND THAT IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS OF SUCH FOSS LICENSE(S). CUSTOMER EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT, PRIOR TO COPYING, MODIFYING, OR DISTRIBUTING ANY FOSS, IT WILL CONFIRM THAT IT HAS ALL NECESSARY RIGHTS AND PERMISSIONS TO DO SO FROM THE APPLICABLE THIRD PARTY LICENSOR (THE “LICENSOR”), WHICH CONFIRMATION MAY INCLUDE OBTAINING A SEPARATE LICENSE FROM THE LICENSOR EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZING IT TO DO SO. 9.

Customer agrees that all Feedback is and shall be given by Customer entirely voluntarily. Samsung shall be free to use disclose, reproduce, license or otherwise distribute and exploit the Feedback in its discretion, without restriction, accounting, or other obligation of any kind or nature.

If Indemnitor does not deliver a Notice of Assumption relating to any claim within the required notice period, or if, after the assumption of the defense by Indemnitor, Indemnitor has failed to defend the claim diligently, Indemnitee shall have the right to defend the claim in such manner as it may deem appropriate.

By placing your Order for the Services, clicking/checking any “I Agree” button or box or similar on the website in connection with your purchase, you agree to be bound by these Terms and conditions. The Services and Deliverables provided by Samsung are intended for internal business use unless permitted by Samsung in writing. If you purchased Services through a reseller, final prices and sales terms will be between you and the reseller; however, payment terms apply to Samsung's provision of the Services to you. Section 3 below sets forth the payment terms that apply to you if Services are purchased from Samsung resellers, and Section 4 provides the terms for purchasing Services from Samsung's authorized resellers or distributors, including fees, terms, and conditions for service delivery, and the terms of use for the services provided by these services. As used herein, “Services” means each Samsung enterprise service offering as described in a service guide (each, a “Samsung Service Guide”), with specific projects, tasks, functions, responsibilities, and services to be furnished by Samsung to the customer. Service Descriptions should have the meanings as set forth in the applicable Order. Capitalized terms used but not defined in these Terms or Conditions shall have the same meanings as described within the Order. The terms and Conditions are agreed between (i) you, either individually if agreeing to it in your own capacity, or if you are authorized to agree to these terms on behalf of your company or another entity, between the entity for whose benefit you act (in either case, \"you\", \"your” or \"Customer\"), and (ii) Samsung Electronics America, Inc. („Samsung\"), which is responsible for the provision of these services to you, and (iii) for the delivery of these Services to your organization, including service levels, performance requirements, milestones, project plans, and license rights for Deliverables. Here are the key points: 1. Services. Each Samsung Service Guide or Order describes: (i), available service options; (ii),\"deliverables,\" assumptions, conditions, and dependencies impacting the Services or upon which the pricing or delivery of the services might be based;\n"
